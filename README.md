Hi I'm @NunoR93, I'm a programmer with some experience in Java and Python, and know a little of C#, I don't have much to show for now. 

I dropped out of college, was attending a CS course, but life had other plans for me, so at the moment I'm managing a pizza place.

Currently I'm taking a course on Gamedev on Unity, so I'm still learning a bit of C#.
I love to code, and solve problems through coding. 
I did some small projects for personal use, like a work hours calculator that gets the info from a machine we have at work.

You can reach me through my email nuno1993r@icloud.com
